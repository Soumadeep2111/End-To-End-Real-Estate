# End-To-End-Real-Estate

Creating a Machine learning project on a real life esatate property problem.

In this project I will be analyzing the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values and much more. At the end we present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features. I will use concepts like cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, cross validation and sampling work in action.

While developing this project, features used are :
1) `Python`
2) `Numpy`
3) `Pandas`
4) `Matplotlib`
5) `Scikit-learn`

# To Start the code :
1) Open Administrative Windows Powershell
2) Type `cd "location of the project"` and Enter
3) Type `jupyter notebook` and Enter
4) The Jupyter Notebook will open in the browser
